# ender3v3-klipper-configs

I am a proud owner of Ender 3V3 KE printer.
I wanted to use the G-sensor and input shaping, so imagine my disappointment after ordering the sensor and Sonic Pad and figuring out that:
a) the built-in Nebula tablet _does run_ Klipper with G-shaping feature, but the sensor I ordered came with barrel connector and Nebula needs a seperate sensor<->usb c cable that you can only order on Aliexpress. Ugh!
b) the sonic pad which I paid a ton of money for, _does not support_ 3V3 KE, only SE!

After 2 days of hacking, and 100 failed configs, I was able to fully run 3v3 KE with input shaping using this new config...
